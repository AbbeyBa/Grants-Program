Building a NFT based Loyalty program through event curation that is focused on creator and community-led adventure themed P2P education through create to earn, interact to earn mechanism's,  for emerging markets and underrepresented communities
**(Marketplace or Storefront as a function and NFT as a utility)**
**Near address: carolinecares.near**
**What’s the Go-To-Market strategy? (Most important!)**

**Step-1** Onboarding explorers in Krisullis Nigeria 

- Krisullis has researched existing content on NEAR and mintbase
- This Curated content from NEAR, Mintbase is segmented into workflows to ease the simplification and use of beginners joining in
- Krisullis is facilitating weekly sessions to mentor, guide and provide weekly live interaction, reading resources and post-recorded content to access and practice 
- Questions and clarification is being addressed in the telegram hub for all members to benefit from

**Step-2** Minting NFTs in stores :

- The next level is bringing them as minters into the Krisullis marketplace 
- They are taught how to mint their own nfts 
- They are shown how to involve their communities into this 
- They have a dedicated mentor and coach 
- Krisullis provides reward points through NFTS and NEAR tokens for the learning and milestones they are achieving each week through airdrops and claims (currently done manually, process maps being created simultaneously

We repeat this cycle with the next cohort in Nigeria 

**Preparation for creators before launches of campaigns and events:**
**Event Workshop :**

- Before creators are live, Krisullis facilitates a live and interactive workshop for creators to participate and learn more about the design, facilitation, and implementation of a successful event or campaign 
- 
- In this stage creators are involved by way of designing sub projects based on their individual passion, interests and expertise areas

**Objective :** to help members know they are creators and that creators see the real-life utility benefits of nfts into each creator’s projects
